## Introduction

Welcome to the F1 Race Outcome Predictor repository! This project utilizes Pytorch to predict the outcomes of Formula 1 races, merging the thrill of motorsports with the cutting-edge world of machine learning.

## Project Overview

This project was born out of a passion for both Formula 1 racing and the possibilities within the realm of artificial intelligence. By analyzing historical race data, we aim to build a model that can predict race outcomes with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

## Getting Started

This project was developed and tested with:

- Python 3.11.5
- Torch 2.1.2
- Pandas 2.1.4
- Numpy 1.26.2
- Scikit-learn 1.4.0

After installation run the training script with:
```python training.py```
